#Student Handbook

This is your primary resource. Here is information on the computer science program, its faculty, its classes, how to survive the tough ones, and plenty more. Thinking of entering computer science? You'll find plenty of information here on enrollment, what courses to register for, and tips on traversing Lakehead's website (e.g. avoid doing that).

##Introduction

Computer Science has grown into an incredibly broad topic - almost every field on earth now requires computer scientists in the workforce. Out of University, it is HARD to not find a job - it is a very in demand major.

So, what is computer science? Google tells me it's the "study of the principles and use of computers", but that's not a very good description. So here's what MTU says:

    Computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice. It requires thinking
    both in abstract terms and in concrete terms. The practical side of computing can be seen
    everywhere. Nowadays, practically everyone is a computer user, and many people are even
    computer programmers. Getting computers to do what you want them to do requires intensive
    hands-on experience. But computer science can be seen on a higher level, as a science of
    problem solving. Computer scientists must be adept at modeling and analyzing problems.
    They must also be able to design solutions and verify that they are correct. Problem
    solving requires precision, creativity, and careful reasoning.

    Computer science also has strong connections to other disciplines. Many problems in science,
    engineering, health care, business, and other areas can be solved effectively with computers,
    but finding a solution requires both computer science expertise and knowledge of
    the particular application domain. Thus, computer scientists often become proficient in other subjects.

    Finally, computer science has a wide range of specialties. These include computer architecture,
    software systems, graphics, artifical intelligence, computational science, and software engineering.
    Drawing from a common core of computer science knowledge, each specialty area focuses on particular challenges.

##Streams

At Lakehead University, there are two streams of computer science - business and science.

####Business
In the business stream, you'll be taking primarily business electives on top of your computer science course load. By doing this stream, you'll be provided a path to receiving the entrepreneurship certificate through the Faculty of Business

####Science
In the science stream, you'll be taking science electives (e.g. PHYS 10XX, CHEM 10XX). Which will give you plenty of the mathematics and logical thinking background you'll need to be a successful computer scientist.

##Game Programming Specializations
The Game Programming Specialization is an extra stamp on your degree that shows you took several courses that are extremely helpful (and I would say their content is mandatory) to any game programmer.

##CO-OP Program
As a computer science student, you can choose to take the co-op route. This involves taking a year off (usually your 4th year) and going to work for a company as a computer scientist. Lakehead really excels at getting these opportunities for students. Although they find great opportunities, you have to do the work, creating your resume, applying, filling out thousands of piles of paperwork, etc. Don't worry too much, there's a very helpful [co-op office](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/academics/other-programs/co-op) that will help you with everything. Just make sure you fill out the forms on time, the deadlines are often very early. By the way, many jobs are ONLY offered to co-op students because your wages are subsidized, so that should be incentive enough for you.

Lakehead has offered placements at:

* IBM
* RIM
* CIBC
* Cargill
* TBRRI

and many more...

##Academics
###Introduction To Courses

The courses you take here are generally going to be programming or mathematics related. You don't have to take as many math courses as you used to, but you'll still need Calculus I, Discrete Math and Linear Algebra and a Statistics class. Luckily (if you're not really into that whole maths thing) these will be finished in your first or second year, and the remainder are mostly programming courses, with a few choices of electives thrown in. Without a doubt, every year, you're going to be looking for the web page that has exactly what courses you need to take for that year. We've thrown that list [here (just click on the program you are in at the bottom)](http://navigator.lakeheadu.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&catalogid=21&chapterid=3674&loaduseredits=True) for you, because it's always extremely hard to find.

####Different Program Types

There are 5 main 'programs' in computer science at Lakehead:

* Honours BSc with Co-op
    * This is a five year program as opposed to the usual four.
    * Here you'll need a 70% average in your major (your COMP courses)
    * You're going to need to complete 4 work terms:
        * One in third year Winter
        * One in third year Spring/Summer
        * One in fourth year Spring/Summer
        * One in fifth year Fall

* BSc with Co-op
    * This is a four year program as opposed to a five year program.
    * You need to maintain at least a C average.
    * You'll need to complete two co-op work terms with a 3XXX course code or higher
* BSc
    * This is a three year program with no co-op requirements.
* Honours BSc
    * This is probably the most popular option, but it requires that you maintain a 70% average in your COMP courses
    * You must choose one of the Business or Science streams
    * You need to take several FCE's outside of COMP and MATH
* Computer Science Minor
    * If you want to declare a minor in computer science you need:
        * COMP 1411, COMP 1431, COMP 2412, COMP 2477
        * Two more COMP courses at second year or higher level
        * Two more courses at third year or higher level

####What are Electives

There are really several tiers of electives. Sometimes, you'll be told you can "choose one of the following X courses" and then they'll give you a list of allowable courses. This is the lowest tier and least elective-y. The next will be something like "choose X numbers of courses from Y department" which you'll run into if you choose the science stream, you'll need to take several courses from one of the disciplines (BIOL, PHYS, CHEM etc...). The third tier is the one where you actually get to choose which course you want to take - so if you've always wanted to learn Finnish, you can do that. There aren't a lot of these, so choose them wisely. They can often act as a mark booster, or you can use them as an opportunity to learn something from a different field.

####Minors

This is something you're not often told about except for MAYBE one email in your first or second year. You can declare a minor if you'd like, which is an extra qualification that will go on your degree. The ones you'll most likely want to choose are [business](http://navigator.lakeheadu.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&catalogid=21&chapterid=3455&loaduseredits=True), [Biology](http://navigator.lakeheadu.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&catalogid=21&chapterid=3672&topicgroupid=11862&loaduseredits=True),  [Physics](http://navigator.lakeheadu.ca/Catalog/ViewCatalog.aspx?pageid=viewcatalog&catalogid=21&chapterid=3686&topicgroupid=12046&loaduseredits=True), and [Mathematics](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/academics/departments/math/undergraduate-program/minor-in-math). You might be thinking "where's Chemistry?" - well, there isn't a minor in chemistry at Lakehead, so you're out of luck.

####What is an Audit

If you took an unconventional way of getting to the computer science program, you might find yourself having extra electives, or maybe even courses that could be considered equivalents to computer science degree courses. If this is the case - don't trust the built in Lakehead degree auditor (I won't even link it to you) because it's severely out of date. In addition, it won't be of much help to go to one of the student service people and have them do a degree audit for you, because they're often not that familiar with any one program. Your best bet is to talk to the chair of the computer science department [Dr. Maurice Benson](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/users/B/mwbenson/node/17256). He's extremely helpful and will go through all your courses with you to see what can be used as equivalents, and what courses you absolutely need to take still.

###Calculating Your GPA

For a 100.0 GPA scale (the type that Lakehead uses) you don't need to do anything to calculate your GPA. But if you're applying for Grad school, Medical school, Law school, or a job, you'll likely need/want to convert your GPA to the more standard 4.0 scale. This is fairly easy, there's a conversion table [here](http://studentsuccess.mcmaster.ca/students/tools/gpa-conversion-chart.html) (thanks McMaster). We're also working on setting up a more automated version so that you can just copy and paste your transcript and get the converted number.

####Beginning a New School Year

#####Remember to do Your Best Because
  <ul>
  <li>You, or your parents are paying for your education. So, the less courses you repeat, the more you save.</li>
  <li>Once you graduate, you will need to prove you know what you claim to know, when it comes to getting a job.</li>
  <li>You may want to go to grad school after. To get into grad school, you need high marks for your undergrad.</li>
  <li>Learning computer science is awesome! You will be able to determine what aspects of the field insipre you, with the more you learn.</li>
  </ul>
  
#####Materials to Get

  <ul>
  <li>Laptop (duh). Make sure it runs smoothly, and the wi-fi works. Other than that, any laptop and operating system is fine.</li>
  <li>Pencil, pens, eraser.</li>
  <li>Notebook. Ones with 5 sections in it are great, only need one notebook for the semester.</li>
  <li>Lined paper, calculator. (If you're taking math courses, this is a must)</li>
  <li>Books. Go to LU's online book store, select your classes, and find the books you need.
        Note: You may not need the book, depending on the course. If you do need it, type the "{{book's names}} + pdf" into Google and download it to your computer using the browser's tools (Safari ex: File -> Export as PDF...), or search a torrent site such as (https://www.thepiratebay.org) and (https://kat.al). You might be able to save a couple hundred dollars.</li>
  </ul>

###The Tough Classes and How to Survive

A class being 'hard' is generally pretty subjective, it really depends on what you're interested in. In computer science, a class definitely doesn't have to be difficult if you put the time in. Not only this, but there are so many resources it's extremely difficult NOT to find an answer to your question.

Important things to remember for classes you're finding difficult:
  <ol>
  <li>Literally type your questions into Google. Despite your parents not being able to master this skill, we believe in you!</li>
  <li> YouTube is your friend. Type in the subject and you'll likely find an explanation of it.</li>
  <li> Do your assignments. Even if you're not 100% sure how to do an assignment/implement an algorithm, do what you can. You'll be surprised the marks you can get by just doing as much as you can.</li>
  <li> Try not to code an entire project in one night. You'll be surprised the problems you can run into.</li>
  <li> Talk to your professor, they're always willing to help and will sometimes give you a very detailed explanation of what you need to do</li>
  <li> This is probably the most obvious one for a programmer, but if you can't immediately think of how to solve a problem, check Stackoverflow, because there's a 99% chance someone has already solved it.</li>
  </ol>
###The Project Classes and How to Survive

After your first couple years, there are ALOT of project classes you'll be taking. These consist of classes where the majority of your mark is coming from projects you do in class, or where the projects themselves will be taking up most of your time. These include:

* Mobile computing
    * In this one, you'll have ~5 projects that you're given 1 week to complete. YOU WILL NEED THIS ENTIRE WEEK. The programming languages you use vary from week to week, and you'll often need to learn ones you've never had exposure to while you're completing the project. You will likely not have been taught any web development at this point, but will have a project due 2 weeks after class starts that is entirley HTML/javascript.
* Cloud computing/Web Health Informatics/Big Data
    * These three all have one major project in them that runs the course of the semester. You pick your own project (with guidance) from the professor, so make sure you pick something you'll be interested in working on for the next 4 months.
* Advanced project
    * This is the class held in your final semester where you choose to either make a 3D multiplayer game, or a project of sufficient challenge unrelated to gaming. There are options given to you by the professor, but you are free to choose your own as long as you submit a proposal and it gets approved. Again, make sure to pick something you're interested in, double points if you make something that has value.

###Issues with Grades

If you have an issue with your final grade, and have a valid complaint, there's a good chance you can get your final grade amended. There's a fairly in depth [document](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/faculty-and-staff/policies/student-related/reappraisal-and-academic-appeals/) that has all the details on submitting an academic appeal.

If it turns out you didn't pass a class, but had a mark greater than 40%, you can usually write a special exam that can bump your mark up to a passing grade.

###Essential Software

In your first you'll be using Visual Studio 20XX almost exclusively, so make sure you install it wherever you need to and learn how to use it. Of course this is what the school uses because they have largely Windows machines, but Xcode or some other C/C++ IDE (integrated development environment, the place you actually write your code) such as CodeBlocks will work just fine. Visual Studio and Xcode are by far the most beginner-friendly, and both still have plenty of features.

In second year you start to move away from C and C++ and into Java/web development. You'll definitely need a nice IDE for Java, the professor will recommend Netbeans, but IntelliJ IDEA is an excellent choice as well. For web development you have a lot more choices because you're just writing code, not compiling it. Good text editors are: Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++.

In later years you'll be working with so many programming languages, and will have likely built up your own preferences, it's best to find your own at that point.
