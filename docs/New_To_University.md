#Tips
  <ul>
  <li>Eat well, be organized, and dress properly. You want to aim to build habits suitable for a professional job,
  and independent living over time. Also, the better you feel, the less stress you will experience.</li>
  <li>Go to your professor's office hours. They will answer any question you have, and will know you are trying your best.</li>
  <li>Read sections to be cover before lectures. If you know what’s going to get cover ahead of time, 
  this will allow you to follow along in lectures with ease.</li>
  <li>Go to every lecture, and be respectful. If the class size is small enough for you to be noticed,
  your prof will have more respect for you, maybe more flexible. Great plan for a reference later!
  Plus, you will know what’s being covered, what’s important, and you will be able to better retain what you learn.</li>
  <li>Do all assigned work as soon as you can. You will not forget what you were assigned, prevent a heap of assignments 
  from forming, have time to fix mistakes/errors, and have less to stress about.</li>
  <li>Online lecture notes. Some profs will post everything online. In some cases, if the class is easy, 
  or you can copy it down a lot faster (if the prof just goes over the text in them), 
  it may be to your benefit not to go to them. You just to have a feel for how you are doing in the course.</li>
  <li>Start studying at least a week before your exam. Use any avalible resources to assist yourself, such as PAST EXAMS.
  It may be worth asking your professor what will be on the exam.</li>
  <li>Keep cool! Most likely, the course has remained the same for a while, and students have pass the course. If you persist, you will succeed.</li>

#Helpful Term Outline
#####Week 1
Go to lectures, get your syllabuses. The first 30 minutes will be the prof just talking most likely, 
after that the lecture will start. You may get one or two assignments this week. Perfect time to get acquitted to new people. 

#####Weeks 2-3
Things will start picking up more. Maybe some weekly assignment going on, make a schedule, fix it,
and stick to it. Don’t forget to try and have fun on the side (friends, clubs, planned activities, explore the city).

#####Weeks 4-6
Start to think about studying for your midterms, it will be tougher the longer you wait. 
Work to finish new assignments coming your way. Check your course syllabuses, or ask the prof when the midterm is. 
If you have a lot of exams before the break, think about studying earlier. Also, remember the exam date may not be 
set in stone, if enough people request it be moved due to other exam dates, the prof may be kind.

#####Fall break, hooray! (first one for Lakehead)
Relax, but study a bit toward the end for week 7 exams. You are going to start to get assignments again when you get back,
and your free time will disappear again.

#####Weeks 7-9
Finish up your midterms, and continue to complete new assignments. 
Things will probably get more relaxed after midterms, since you are not studying and have less to focus on.

#####Weeks 10-12
Take the time to look at your final exam schedule, then plan when you're going to study for each subject. 
If there are a lot of exams within the first week after the last day of class, try to study beginning week 11 
(You got to study a whole course now). Or else you should probably be fine starting week 12. 
Keep attending the last of your lectures, that stuff may not have an assignment for marks, but it will be on the exam.

#####Last day of class
Study all day (with breaks) since there is soo much to study for, and it’s coming up quick. Just these 1 to 2 weeks, and then a very rewarding break! 

#####All marks should be up soon
