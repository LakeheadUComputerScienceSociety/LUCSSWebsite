##The Programming Interview

An excellent place to check before you go in for a job interview would be this [link](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/current-students/jobs-and-career/job-search/interview-preparation). This is a very general guide, and will likely help you with many of the questions, for something more specific, here's another [link](http://louisrli.github.io/blog/2014/01/18/tips-for-computer-science-internship-interviews/#.V2cvNPkrJhF). However, this is computer science, so you should also expect programming questions. These range from extremely easy (if you know what you're talking about) to some extremely challenging questions.

There are tons of resources for practice interview questions on the internet, here's some links to a few:

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/)
* [Nerd Paradise](http://www.nerdparadise.com/tech/interview/)
* [Java Specific Questions](https://biginterview.com/blog/2014/05/java-interview-questions.html)
