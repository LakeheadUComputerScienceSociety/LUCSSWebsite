# Welcome to LUCSS

Welcome to the Lakehead University Computer Science Society. Here we'll try to gather as much information as possible to help you, the students.

If you have questions, or don't find the answer here - feel free to contact us!

This site is under-construction, permanently. There is always more information you can add to help people. Checkout the Get Involved page for details on helping out.
